wOOp!
=====

wOOp! is a proof-of-concept bookmarking/read-me-later service build with [silex][sx], javascript and a lot of coffee.

It uses a [bookmarklet][bl] to allow users to add pages to an online archive of links for later use.

Requirements
------------

  PHP 5.3 with sqlite3 support


__Remember__ to run: `git submodule update --recursive --init` otherwis you will end up missing a lot of libraries


Limitations
-----------

For now the service only support none-ssl links, as ssl links has some security addons, and needs this service to run ssl as well - currently this is not so.
